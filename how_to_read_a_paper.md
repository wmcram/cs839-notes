# How to Read a Paper
Summary: Like it says on the tin.

## Three-Pass Method:

#### Pass 1 (5-10min)
Goals:
- Just skim the paper
- Decide to bail or continue other two passes

Method:
- Closely read title, abstract, intro
- Read only (sub)section headings, no content
- Read conclusions
- Sweep references

After the first pass, we can answer 5 Cs:
1. Category
2. Context
3. Correctness
4. Contributions
5. Clarity

#### Pass 2 (<1 Hr)
Idea is to read more carefully, but ignore super technical details (math proofs).
More note-taking is necessary here. We want to understand the main ideas and be able
to explain them to someone else convincingly. 

Things to look for:
- Figures, diagrams, charts (statistical significance?)
- Mark interesting unread references
- Things you don't understand on sight

#### Pass 3 (2-5 Hrs)
We now aim for full understanding. This usually involves recreating the work or at least
having the technical details down cold. 

- Examine all assumptions made by authors
- Compare to how you would present/explain ideas
- Identify weaknesses and missing citations

## Literature Survey
- Use a search engine (Google Scholar) to find 3-5 recent papers
- One pass all of them (can often find someone else's survey this way)
- Find repeated names/citations -> key players in field
