# Universal Quantum Simulators
Summary: The author shows that Feynmann's conjecture on quantum simulation was correct; that is, quantum computers can simulate local quantum systems in time and space polynomial in the number of Qubits required to describe the system.

- A key application of quantum computers is efficient simulation of quantum systems
- Feynmann conjectured that there is a class of universal quantum simulators which can simulate any quantum system which evolves "locally"
- Decoherence in the computer can be exploited to realize decoherence in the simulated system
- Two classes of experimental operations based on whether they preserve coherence (Hamiltonian evolution or not)
- "Turning on and off" a set of Hamiltonian operators can drive a system along any unitary U = e^(iAt) with A lying in the set generated by the Hamiltonians
- Linear (quantum) vs Exponential (classical) quantum simulation memory bounds
- Still must construct an exponentially large U in the quantum case
- This is greatly reduced if we restrict to systems with locality (i.e. any system which respects SR/GR)

The idea is that we want to drive the state from A -> B in state space, but the simulator can only take certain directions.

- A system with local effects can have its Hamiltonian decomposed into operators H_i acting on subspaces
- We evolve the system in discrete timesteps just as in classical simulation, and we can also split up into the decomposition above
- Operations needed is (num_timesteps) * (num subspaces) * (max_subspace_dimension^2)
- Locality forces the number of subspaces to be polynomial in N with some error (nearest neighbor, next nearest, etc. for more accuracy)
- Time required to simulate is proportional to simulated timespan
- Open systems can be simulated with at most double the qubits
- Paper talks about how arbitrary states can be initialized and that we can read out arbitrary qubits
